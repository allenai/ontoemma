File format

This is a jsonlines file describing pairs of knowledgebase entities and whether or not they align. 

Each entry consists of:
source_ent: a dictionary of information about the source entity
target_ent: a dictionary of information about the target entity
label: either 0 or 1, where 0 indicates a non-match and 1 a match

Each entity contains the research entity id, canonical name, aliases, definition, parent relations, child relations, and mention contexts. 

An example entry:

            "FHCA and MHCA were not identified as risk factors of weekly weight gain , after adjusting for possible confounders ( maternal ethnicity , parity , smoking during pregnancy , infant gender , IUGR status , SGA status , antenatal steroids , total fluid intake , late - onset sepsis , BPD ) .",
            "Higher emphasis on lifestyle modifications using a new standardized tool is strongly recommended for those with a FHCA , as well as individuals who are at high risk , together with their family members .",
            "Compared to women with no FHCA , women with FHCA were more likely to simultaneously smoke and be exposed to passive smoking ( aOR , 1.65 ; 95% CI , 1.17 to 2.31 ) and to simultaneously smoke and be physically inactive ( aOR , 1.62 ; 95% CI , 1.00 to 2.64 ) .",
            "RESULTS Compared to women with no FHCA , women with FHCA were more likely to smoke ( adjusted odds ratio [ aOR ] , 1.32 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.06 to 1.65 ) , to be exposed to passive smoking ( aOR , 1.21 ; 95% CI , 1.15 to 1.65 ) , and less likely to engage in regular exercise ( aOR , 1.20 ; 95% CI , 1.01 to 1.41 ) .",

            "In this study , BCA , FHCA and a novel analog 5-fluoro-2-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde ( FBCA ) , were demonstrated to decrease growth and colony formation of human colon - derived HCT 116 and mammary - derived MCF-7 carcinoma cells under non - adhesive conditions .",
            "Induction of Tumor Cell Death through Targeting Tubulin and Evoking Dysregulation of Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins by Multifunctional Cinnamaldehydes Multifunctional trans - cinnamaldehyde ( CA ) and its analogs display anti - cancer properties , with 2-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde ( BCA ) and 5-fluoro-2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde ( FHCA ) being identified as the ortho - substituted analogs that possess potent anti - tumor activities .",
            "Combined effects of selected health behaviors for FHCA were significant , although no statistically significant interactions were observed between selected health behaviors .",
            "CONCLUSION The study found that women with a FHCA exhibited unhealthy behaviors compared to women without FHCA .",
            "PURPOSE The aim of this study was to examine the health - related behaviors related to a family history of cancer ( FHCA ) among Korean women underwent cancer screening ."
